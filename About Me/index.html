    <h2>Anthony Vela</h2>
    <p>My name is Anthony, nick-name andros/androx within the world of e-sports. 
        I am from Lima, Peru. I am 24 years old and I love computers, soccer, sci-fi movies and of course video games.</p>
    <p>Since I was very young I have liked sports in general, I played minor league soccer when I was young until an injury made me change course to the world of video games.
        At the beginning of the pandemic I was able to have my fisrt experience as a professional e-sports player in two tier 2 leagues (LVP Peru and LVP Ecuador).
        I currently work with my father and as a positional coach in a formative team in my country.</p>
    <p>Upon entering this virtual world, the world of computers, web development and everything that makes up work behind a screen caught my attention.
        When thinking about web development, the internet and everything that is coming in the future, I see many advantages.
        And it is the area where I would like to dedicate myself professionally.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints since I was 8 years old.
        I served in the Peru Trujillo South Mission and my favorite scriptures are found within the books of Moses and Abraham.</p>
