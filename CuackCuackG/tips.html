                <h1>Tips and Info</h1>
                <p>
                    Here you will find relative information to learn and study, tips that will help with your short, medium and long-term training. 
                    You will also find tips to make your training more meaningful and applicable tips to improve your style of play.
                </p>
                <p>We will focus on gathering the best possible information, from the best current pages that upload updated content (OPGG, LolAlitycs, blitz and more that we consider to have relevant information for your learning).
                    We will share minigames to practice and develop skills that improve us in our individual game as minigames to speed up memory, improve our visual reactions and motor agility (eyes - brain - fingers)</p>
                    <p>We will also share dynamics to improve communication and trust between the player and the team (inside and outside the game). 
                        Let's remember that trust and the way of communicating within the game greatly influences the decisions made in the game and those that allow us to win. 
                        Good communication and better decisions will always take us closer to victory.

                    <p>Something very important that not everyone takes much into account, is that we do not consider the time we are sitting at the computer and the friction time that our fingers sufer when in constant movement, there are a series of exercises and very good tips to avoid a very common muscle disease among elite players is tendinitis.
