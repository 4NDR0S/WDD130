      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <h3>Why will people come to your site?</h3>
      <p>
        With the technological and sports development that is taking place in recent years, the e-sports industry is taking a fairly high role, MOBA, SHOOTERS or RPG games that we previously only considered as one more video game in the market of the computers, are generating, captivating and motivating young people and adults to play and compete in them. Every day young people and adults install multiple video games, purchased or free, and get hooked on them until they are the best. This opens up a strong market industry of competitive internet content to compete with sports broadcast on television and/or the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being aware of this progress and how fast this industry is growing, I want to create a seedbed of talented young people who have the ability and willingness to play and compete at the highest level, eventually.
      </p>
      <h3>What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them?</h3>
      <p>
        Being a seedbed of young promises within this new world of video games, many parents of young people should ask themselves how many hours they are going to invest or perhaps the risk of believing that their children may develop some kind of vice.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would like to answer that although rigorous hours are going to be practiced (That will depend on each young person) we take the responsibility of teaching them sports discipline and a set of tricks so that when they are "playing" they don't just "play", but improve and develop qualities of a high-end professional player, in other words the youngster is not going to play for leisure or fun, he is going to play for TRAINING.
