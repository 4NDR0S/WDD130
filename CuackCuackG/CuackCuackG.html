        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>With the technological and sports development that is taking place in recent years, the e-sports industry is taking a fairly high role, MOBA, SHOOTERS or RPG games that we previously only considered as one more video game in the market of the computers, are generating, captivating and motivating young people and adults to play and compete in them. Every day young people and adults install multiple video games, purchased or free, and get hooked on them until they are the best. This opens up a strong market industry of competitive internet content to compete with sports broadcast on television and/or the internet.
        Being aware of this progress and how fast this industry is growing, I want to create a seedbed of talented young people who have the ability and willingness to play and compete at the highest level, eventually.
        </p>
      <p>Being a seedbed of young promises within this new world of video games, many parents of young people should ask themselves how many hours they are going to invest or perhaps the risk of believing that their children may develop some kind of vice.
        I would like to answer that although rigorous hours are going to be practiced (That will depend on each young person) we take the responsibility of teaching them sports discipline and a set of tricks so that when they are "playing" they don't just "play", but improve and develop qualities of a high-end professional player, in other words the youngster is not going to play for leisure or fun, he is going to play for TRAINING.
        Also always to consider is the question of "why?" "Is this career or profession really profitable?", and the answer is "Yes"! but it depends on many factors, if the youngster has the qualities to reach a really competitive league. It all depends on the qualities and development that the young person has. As we are used to here in (South America), we dream of our son becoming a professional soccer player, it is practically the same for this electronic sport (the salaries, the staff, the fans). Something to consider is to stop seeing it as just another little game and see it as it really is, it's a SPORT.
        </p>
      <p>
        Throughout their stay in training schedules, young people will receive and carry out these activities:</p>
      <p>1. Review informative and updated information for each patch of changes they make within the game.</p>
      <p>2. Better pages with relative information to improve your way of arming yourself within the game.</p>
      <p>3. Best rune building pages for your most used champions.</p>
      <p>4. A list of mini games and activities that develop and improve their motor skills.</p>
      <p>5. Customs and patterns to become more disciplined in and out of training hours.</p>
      <p>6. Tips to deal with the stress and frustration of losing too many games.</p>
      <p>7. Dealing with pressure at big games or knowing people are watching your game.</p>
      <p>8. Better organize your times and schedules for a more thorough training.</p>

      <p>There is a lot of information that you can find on the internet, but we are going to try to make a filter to offer or recommend only the most optimal, the one that is most updated and the one that has the best results within the competitive and solo field.
        Obviously knowing that the degree of discipline you exercise will greatly influence the progress you have within the project and your expectations.
        The time you dedicate and the added values â€‹such as your mechanical skills and learning process will be reflected in your short, medium and long-term results.</p>

      <p>As mentioned before we will use information from other pages, but we will filter that information to make it the most optimized and simplest for the amateur player to understand.
        We will focus especially on the process from amateur to professional player from tier 3 - tier 2 (There are not many of these pages and those that exist charge an amount for the coaching performed)
        Direct contact with myself to help in a more personalized way and a free entry to the discord server where more things, coaching and live gameplays will be shared.

      <h3>Tips and Info</h3>
      <p>
        Here you will find relative information to learn and study, tips that will help with your short, medium and long-term training. You will also find tips to make your training more meaningful and applicable tips to improve your style of play.
      </p>
      <p>We will focus on gathering the best possible information, from the best current pages that upload updated content (OPGG, LolAlitycs, blitz and more that we consider to have relevant information for your learning).
        We will share minigames to practice and develop skills that improve us in our individual game as minigames to speed up memory, improve our visual reactions and motor agility (eyes - brain - fingers)</p>
        <p>We will also share dynamics to improve communication and trust between the player and the team (inside and outside the game). Let's remember that trust and the way of communicating within the game greatly influences the decisions made in the game and those that allow us to win. Good communication and better decisions will always take us closer to victory.
        </p>
        <p>And something very important that not everyone takes much into account, is that we do not consider the time we are sitting at the computer and the friction time that our fingers sufer when in constant movement, there are a series of exercises and very good tips to avoid a very common muscle disease among elite players is tendinitis. We will share exercises for the best functioning of our hands, fingers and back, so as not to suffer from these diseases later.</p>

      <h3>Strong Mentality</h3>
      <p>
        Here you will find tips to deal with frustration, how to manage and deal with a losing streak, deal with stress and pressure in and out of the game, stress and pressure in the competitive environment and how to concentrate more in a soloq game and a high level game.
      </p>
      <p>As is well known, NO ONE likes to lose. And losing is something very common in the world of video games. Losing is something that we should be used to and use those losses in our favor, but very few players (amateurs and those who play just for fun) do not take advantage of it. Here we will teach you how to deal with this, how to learn from each defeat and improve in the process.</p>
      <p>
        To start with this, we must first learn about ourselves, recognize our tolerance limit that we have with defeat, EVERY player has a tolerance limit and knowing our limit is the first step to improve our tolerance capacity.
        With this mentioned, we will share advice, tips and things we can do to first recognize our limits and then deal with them, over time this habit will free us from stress and we will be able to train more quality hours.

        This video game is compared a lot with chess, surely you have wondered why. And why is very simple. The game, although there are mechanics and a thousand ways to play one or more specific champions. The game is always 5 vs 5 and the way to win is by playing as a team, achieving organic and inorganic objectives, but everything is simplified to making decisions, the best decisions determine better results and consequently victory. And for the best decisions, a more positive and proactive mentality is necessary, if you can lead better with pressure and stress, it is more likely that you will make the best decisions to win. In conclusion, a stronger mind will give us better decisions, better decisions will give better results and better results more victories.
