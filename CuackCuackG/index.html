            <h1>Welcome</h1>
            <section class="main-p">
            <p>With the technological and sports development that is taking place in recent years, the e-sports industry is taking a fairly high role, MOBA, SHOOTERS or RPG games that we previously only considered as one more video game in the market of the computers, are generating, captivating and motivating young people and adults to play and compete in them. Every day young people and adults install multiple video games, purchased or free, and get hooked on them until they are the best. This opens up a strong market industry of competitive internet content to compete with sports broadcast on television and/or the internet.
              Being aware of this progress and how fast this industry is growing, I want to create a seedbed of talented young people who have the ability and willingness to play and compete at the highest level, eventually.
            </p>
            <p>Being a seedbed of young promises within this new world of video games, many parents of young people should ask themselves how many hours they are going to invest or perhaps the risk of believing that their children may develop some kind of vice.
              I would like to answer that although rigorous hours are going to be practiced (That will depend on each young person) we take the responsibility of teaching them sports discipline and a set of tricks so that when they are "playing" they don't just "play", but improve and develop qualities of a high-end professional player, in other words the youngster is not going to play for leisure or fun, he is going to play for TRAINING.
              Also always to consider is the question of "why?" "Is this career or profession really profitable?", and the answer is "Yes"! but it depends on many factors, if the youngster has the qualities to reach a really competitive league. It all depends on the qualities and development that the young person has. As we are used to here in (South America), we dream of our son becoming a professional soccer player, it is practically the same for this electronic sport (the salaries, the staff, the fans). Something to consider is to stop seeing it as just another little game and see it as it really is, it's a SPORT.
            </p>
            <p>There is a lot of information that you can find on the internet, but we are going to try to make a filter to offer or recommend only the most optimal, the one that is most updated and the one that has the best results within the competitive and solo field.
                    Obviously knowing that the degree of discipline you exercise will greatly influence the progress you have within the project and your expectations.
                    The time you dedicate and the added values â€‹such as your mechanical skills and learning process will be reflected in your short, medium and long-term results.</p>
            
            <p>As mentioned before we will use information from other pages, but we will filter that information to make it the most optimized and simplest for the amateur player to understand.
                    We will focus especially on the process from amateur to professional player from tier 3 - tier 2 (There are not many of these pages and those that exist charge an amount for the coaching performed)
                    Direct contact with myself to help in a more personalized way and a free entry to the discord server where more things, coaching and live gameplays will be shared.
